## Course Title
Speculative Spatial Computing Design -- Envisioning Entangled Realities

## Course Abstract
This advanced undergraduate course explores the intersection of speculative design, experiential futures, and mixed reality technologies. Students will critically examine the ethical implications of emerging spatial computing paradigms and then create provocative mixed reality scenarios. Through a combination of theoretical study, hands-on prototyping, and creative development, students will envision and craft experiences that challenge our understanding of reality, interaction, and the future of digital-physical entanglement. The course culminates in the creation of an original mixed reality artifact, a public exhibition, and an academic paper suitable for submission to international conferences in the field.

## Course Objectives

1. Understand how and why the academic system works and gain research abilities to become a research-led designer
2. Learn speculative design and apply speculative design and experiential futures methodologies to spatial computing contexts
3. Hone the ability to shape concepts within a global, trendy context
4. Develop critical thinking skills through research and writing processes
5. Articulate complex ideas through academic writing and artistic expression
6. Prepare an international conference-ready academic paper
